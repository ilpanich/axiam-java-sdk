## [1.0.0-alpha] - 2026-07-15

First alpha release of the official Java client SDK for AXIAM. This is an early,
pre-production preview published to Maven Central for evaluation and feedback —
the public API may still change before the beta and stable releases.

### Added

- REST client (OkHttp) covering the AXIAM API surface (authentication,
  authorization checks, tenant/user/role/resource management).
- gRPC client for low-latency authorization checks.
- Spring Boot integration for guarding application endpoints.
- `io.github.ilpanich:axiam-bom` Bill of Materials to keep SDK artifact
  versions aligned in consumer projects.
- Strict TLS by default with no certificate-verification bypass surface.
- Fully documented public API (Javadoc, published to javadoc.io).
- Spring Boot example application.
